# Team 3 UHN Rehabilitation Remotely Front End part

## Assignment Details


#### 1. Summary of our decisions on Front End part

Our team has made a series of decisions regarding the development of the front-end part of the project. We have prioritized the user interface for patients, as this is the main focus of the project and what the UHN company has requested us to complete first.

In order to meet this requirement, we have divided our efforts into three main areas: the main page, menu bar, and animation page. These interfaces will serve as the backbone of the patient-facing portion of the platform, and will be developed to provide a simple and intuitive user experience.

To further enhance the user experience, we have also developed user registration and login interfaces. These additional features will enable patients to create their own accounts on the platform, providing them with access to personalized information and allowing them to securely interact with the system.

Throughout the development process, we have also placed a strong emphasis on design and visual aesthetics. Our team has worked to create a cohesive and attractive visual style that will be consistent across all aspects of the platform, helping to create a sense of unity and cohesion for the end user.

In addition to the front-end development, we have also made key decisions about the technologies we will use to build the platform. We have selected modern web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as popular front-end frameworks like React and Bootstrap. This choice will enable us to create a modern and responsive platform.

Overall, our team has taken a carefully considered approach to the front-end development of the platform, focusing on meeting UHN's requirements while also creating a platform that is intuitive, attractive, and easy to use. Through our commitment to design and the use of modern web technologies, we are confident that we will be able to deliver a top-quality product that meets the needs of both the UHN company and its patients.

### Our Functionalities


We did it first by implementing the user interface that UHN asked us to do. For the menu bar, when the user clicks the menu bar button, the corresponding option will pop up for the user to choose, and there is a red cross to close the menu bar to prevent the user from accidentally touching it. Secondly, for the main page, our main page contains all the information that UHN requires us to include and implements related functions. Furthermore, for animation, we have achieved real-time video recording of patients and action instructions for 3D model dolls. At the same time, a landmark is achieved on the human joints. In addition, we have created additional user login and registration pages in order to give users a better experience. Below are some screenshots of pdfs about UHN requirements.
