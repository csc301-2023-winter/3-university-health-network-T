 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: March 11th, 2023
 * Where: ONLINE

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. What worked well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions and actions that worked well.

* Establish clear project goals: Define the purpose of the website, what features it should have, and what outcomes you hope to achieve. We focus on the patient panel for the website and put the most effort on the exercise page and meeting page of the website. This will help guide the team's work and keep everyone focused on what needs to be done.
* Define clear roles and responsibilities: We have four people to work on the frontend and three people to work on the server and database. Clearly define each team member's role and responsibilities so that everyone knows what is expected of them. This will help avoid confusion and ensure that tasks are completed on time.
* Use a version control system: Git can help ensure that changes to the code are tracked, reviewed, and approved by team members before being merged into the main codebase.

#### Q2. What did not work well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions and actions that did not work well.

 * Lack of clear communication: there is a lack of clear communication among team members. we are not able to meet in-person due to living far from each other. This leads to misunderstandings, missed deadlines, and low morale.
 * Inadequate testing: The testing of the webiste is not very efficient due to the lack of communation bettwen the front end team and back end team. It results in bugs and errors that may impact the user experience and the success of the project.
 * Failure to document processes: This confuses other memebrs and makes it difficult for new team members to get up to speed on the project.


#### Q3(a). Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and/or how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)
* Improve communication: Ensure that team members are communicating regularly online. This could include daily stand-up meetings, weekly check-ins, and using tools like Wechat and Zoom to facilitate remote collaboration.
* Foster a positive team culture: Create a positive team culture that encourages collaboration, communication, and a focus on quality. This can help keep team members motivated and engaged throughout the project.
* Prioritize testing and quality assurance: Develop a comprehensive testing plan that includes automated testing, manual testing, and user acceptance testing. This will help ensure that the website functions properly and that the user experience is positive.
* Document processes and procedures: Ensure that processes and procedures are documented effectively so that team members can reference them as needed. This will help ensure that everyone is on the same page and that new team members can get up to speed quickly.
* Implement effective time management strategies: Develop strategies for effective time management, including setting realistic deadlines, breaking tasks down into smaller components, and prioritizing tasks based on importance and urgency.
* Encourage collaboration and knowledge sharing: Encourage team members to collaborate and share their knowledge with UHN partners. This can help ensure that everyone is working towards the same goals and that the project benefits from everyone's input.

#### Q3(b). Integration & Next steps
Briefly explain how you integrated the previously developed individuals components as one product (i.e. How did you be combine the code from 3 sub-repos previously created) and if/how the assignment was helpful or not helpful.

 * To integrate code from three sub-repos, we use Git to manage the code from each sub-repo. we pull the code from each sub-repo into a single repository and then merged together by Git subtree. The assignment is helpfull in the most features in the front end. 


## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
 * In the prepration of the demo: 
   * Define the scope and goals of the demo: Determine the purpose of the demo is to show the exercise page and meeting page. 
   * Plan and develop the demo: Plan and develop the demo by selecting appropriate tools and technologies, designing the user interface for the exercise page and meeting page, and coding the functionality and link them to the database and deploy to the Azure cloud.

we present the demo to the UHN partner with the two main function pages , and gather feedback on the features and functionality. The UHN partner satisfied with the features on the two pages. 

He asked us to depoly the web page from the current Azure cloud to the UHN Azure cloud.

Through the process of preparing a virtual rehabilitation website demo, there are several key learnings that can be gained. From a process perspective, the demo can help identify areas for improvement in the development process, such as gaps in communication, lack of clarity in requirements, or issues with testing and quality assurance. Thus, the demo provides valuable insights and feedback that can be used to refine and improve the virtual rehabilitation website.
