## Transfer of ownership to your partner of your repo, cloud accounts, and everything else needed for your partner to continue working on or running the software
- Page 1: We ready two repos and both of them will be transfter to our partner, repo1 is for local version, repo2 is for Azure deploy version.
- Reason: Github action will deploy the code automatically once the code is push in the repo(usually takes 15-20 mins), so user can finish coding locally and then transfer all files in the repo2 to reduce the time.

## Confirmation that you have applied the correct license to the repository
The Academic Free License v3.0 (afl-3.0) should be a good choice for our project.
According to the description of this license on the webpage "https://choosealicense.com/licenses/afl-3.0/", it allows for academic and commercial use, modification, and distribution of software under certain conditions. This aligns well with the nature of our partner company and the purpose of this project, which is to facilitate better and faster recovery for more patients. Therefore, we believe that afl-3.0 is a very good choice.

## The offer of a brief virtual meeting or phone call to ensure the partner is comfortable with the information and can take over your project

## Any other details or steps pertinent to taking over the project
