## Transfer of ownership to your partner of your repo, cloud accounts, and everything else needed for your partner to continue working on or running the software
- Page 1: We ready two repos and both of them will be transfter to our partner, repo1 is for local version, repo2 is for Azure deploy version.
- Reason: Github action will deploy the code automatically once the code is push in the repo(usually takes 15-20 mins), so user can finish coding locally and then transfer all files in the repo2 to reduce the time.
