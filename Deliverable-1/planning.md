#### Q5: Have you decided on how you will build it? Share what you know now or tell us the options you are considering.

Our team  has already determined some of the main features and functionality that the online 

platform will have, including a navigation bar, login feature, a home page that displays 

information related to the patient's recovery process and therapy prescriptions, a feature to 

join virtual therapy sessions, a feature to record sessions, a feature to schedule appointments 

and take notes after each session, a history feature, and a setting feature. We will build the 

front end part basically based on React, Javascript, CSS, HTML5 and some material sources 

to aid us build user-friendly UI/UX. For the Backend, we will typically use Django with a 

database to achieve all functionalities stated above. It's important to note that this is a 

complex task, and requires a lot of resources, planning and testing.
