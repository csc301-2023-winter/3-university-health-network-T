## Decision on dividing the project


## Responsibility on each sub teams

    - Team 1(responsible for UI)
        creating the UI for home page and the recording page which comes with the 3D avatar, including 
        the basic redirecting in between these two pages. If time allows, complete the login and register
        for new account page with the same requirements above.
        
        the final outcomes should include some basic logic that does not involve anything that needs the 
        backend, for example, menu pop ups, page routing, as well as start and stop recording videos 
        (without saving them to the backend)
        

    - Team 2(backend and database)
